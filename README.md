# README for FloatChat: AI-Powered Conversational Interface for Ocean Data

## Project Overview

FloatChat is a next-generation platform designed to democratize access to oceanographic data by combining scientific data processing with advanced AI-powered conversational capabilities. It transforms raw ARGO ocean float data into an interactive, explainable, and scientifically rigorous chat system that enables users to query, visualize, and analyze ocean data without needing specialized coding skills.

## Key Features

- Physics-aware embeddings for better scientific accuracy  
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for safe, auditable LLM-to-SQL translation  
- Multi-modal retrieval augmented generation (RAG) combining text, metadata, and charts  
- Real-time ingestion and visualization using edge agents and LeafletJS  
- Explainability with provenance, quality checks, and confidence scores  
- Intuitive chat interface with dashboard visualizations

## System Architecture

- Data ingestion from NetCDF ARGO profiles â†’ normalized SQL and Parquet storage  
- Vector embeddings with FAISS/Chroma for semantic querying  
- RAG pipeline using LLM with a Model Context Protocol mediator  
- Backend API layer for query execution and data serving  
- Frontend dashboard with AI chat interface, LeafletJS maps, and chart visualizations  
- Deployment with Docker and Kubernetes for scalable and reproducible demos
